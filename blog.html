 <h1 class="text-2xl">2) How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h1>
<p>Ans: To select HTML elements we can use DOM selectors. there are mainly five effective selectors in DOM which are: <br>
  1) getElementById() - the selection is based on the Id name <br>
  2) getElementsByClassName - This selectors returns all the elements that matches the specified Class name  <br>
  3) getElementsByTagName - It returns all the elements that matches the specified Tag name <br> 
  4) querySelector - This one returns the first element that matches the specified CSS selector in the document. <br>
  5) querySelectorAll - It returns all the elements that match the specified CSS selector in the document. <br>
  Beside this some another methods are: getAttribute(), setAttribute(), appendChild(), removeChild(), createElement() etc. <br>

<h1 class="text-2xl">3) What is event bubble?</h1>
 <p>Ans: When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other elements. In example: if we have three specific events like child, parent and grandparent. so first child will work , then parent and then grandparent and that's how it works. </p>
 <br>
<h1 class="text-2xl">4) What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h1>
<p>Ans: Basically a callback function is a function which we can use again or later. when we use a function as 
  an argument of another function, then we can called it callback function. <br>
  When we want one function to execute only after another function has completed its execution, we use callback functions in JavaScript. It needs to pass as a parameter to other functions to make a function callback.
